## Concepts
I have develop a simple project explaining How to integrate SwiftUI into UIKit by loading a remote image from URL(UIKit and SwiftUI) and How to bring previews for UIKit's View controllers.

## Implementation
I have put an article [Integrating SwiftUI With UIKit and Developing Xcode Previews for UIKit's ViewController](https://medium.com/@shankarmadeshvaran/integrating-swiftui-with-uikit-and-developing-xcode-previews-for-uikits-viewcontroller-340a9d0d52d5) about this implementation in Medium.
